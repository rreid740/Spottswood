# Spottswood
Front and back of a relational respresentation of Spottswood's Ethnic Recordings in the US.  The data and database are complete and tested, but there is no web front end nor is there a web service (on a host) to handle traffic.  I'm a data person, not a front end person, so this project is stuck for now.  Reach out to me if you can help with frontend or webservice by contacting {ignore white space and parenthesis) - (rivkelreid) (at) (tutanota) (dot com).

The database is designed to allow broad, arbitrary queries (e.g. what other names did Pawel Humaniouk record under for the Columbia label?)

The Committee for Traditional Music provided the ancient raw data I converted and normalized, thank you.  Unfortunatly, I can query it directly by calling my stored procedures using SQL connected to the DB, but that does no good for anyone else.  I am frustrated this is stuck, but I need someone with the frontend skills to help.
